    <h2>Why This Project?</h2>
    <p>
      This dashboard was built to demonstrate how I approach dense, data-driven
      user interfaces commonly found in internal tools. The focus is on clear
      data flow, predictable state management, and maintainable component
      composition rather than visual complexity.
