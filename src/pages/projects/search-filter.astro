    <ul>
      <li>
        Built with React inside an Astro project to demonstrate framework
        interoperability and selective hydration.
      </li>
      <li>
        Uses controlled inputs and derived state instead of duplicating filtered
        results in state.
      </li>
      <li>
        Accessibility considerations include semantic form grouping, screen
        reader announcements, and keyboard-friendly interactions.
      </li>
      <li>
        UI state is synchronized to URL query parameters to allow bookmarking
        and sharing.
      </li>
      <li>Styles are scoped using CSS Modules to avoid global side effects.</li>
    </ul>
