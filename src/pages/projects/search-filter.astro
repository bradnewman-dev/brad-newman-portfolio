    <h1>Search & Filter Interface (React)</h1>
    <p>
      An interactive search, filter, and sorting interface built with React to
      demonstrate common frontend patterns used in data-driven applications. The
      UI synchonizes state with URL query parameters and ephasizes accessibility
      and predictable component behavior.

    <ul>
      <li>
        Built with React inside an Astro project to demonstrate framework
        interoperability and selective hydration.
      </li>
      <li>
        Uses controlled inputs and derived state instead of duplicating filtered
        results in state.
      </li>
      <li>
        Accessibility considerations include semantic form grouping, screen
        reader announcements, and keyboard-friendly interactions.
      </li>
      <li>
        UI state is synchronized to URL query parameters to allow bookmarking
        and sharing.
      </li>
      <li>Styles are scoped using CSS Modules to avoid global side effects.</li>
    </ul>
