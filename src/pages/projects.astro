    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>
      These projects are designed to demonstrate how I approach frontend
      development in real-world scenarios. They focus on interactive user
      interfaces, state management, accessibility, and maintainable component
      architecture, using React where appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surrounding site is intentionally kept lightweight to keep the focus
      on the interactive project work.

      <h3>Search & Filter Interface (React)</h3>
      <p>
        An interactive search, filter, and sorting interface built with React to
        demonstrate common frontend patterns used in data-driven applications.
        The UI synchonizes state with URL query parameters and ephasizes
        accessibility and predictable component behavior.
