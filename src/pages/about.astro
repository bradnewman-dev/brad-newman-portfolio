    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I’m a frontend developer who enjoys building thoughtful, user-focused
      interfaces. My work centers on React, modern JavaScript, and writing
      maintainable UI code.
    </p>

    <p>
      I care about accessibility, performance, and clear communication, and I
      enjoy collaborating with designers and backend engineers to bring ideas to
      life.
