    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a frontend developer with 7 years of professional experience building
      and maintaining React applications in production environments. Most of my
      work has focused on React-based interfaces used by real users at scale.
    </p>

    <p>
      I care deeply about clean component architecture, accessibility, and
      performance. I prioritize writing code that is readable, maintainable, and
      easy for other developers to work with.
    </p>

    <p>
      This portfolio is intentionally built using a mix of static pages and
      interactive React components to demonstrate how I approach frontend
      problems in production settings.
